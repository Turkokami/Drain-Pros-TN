/**
 * LOCATION REGISTRY
 *
 * Every location binds to exactly one permit jurisdiction. That binding tells
 * the office which desk a permitted job files with. It no longer decides which
 * services the page renders — see config/policy.ts and lib/scope-guard.ts.
 *
 * Location pages must carry material a competitor cannot copy: which utility
 * serves the town, the housing stock, whether it runs on septic or city sewer,
 * and real local work. A thin location page is worse than no location page.
 * `localFacts` is where that lives, and the linter enforces a minimum.

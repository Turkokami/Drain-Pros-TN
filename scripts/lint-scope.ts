 * SCOPE LINTER — runs before every build. Exit code 1 fails the build.
 *
 *   npm run lint:scope
 *
 * Nine checks, in the order they matter:
 *
 *   1  No street address anywhere in the repo (service-area business rule)
 *   2  License not expired
 *   3  No unqualified "lifetime" warranty language
 *   4  Out-of-scope work never appears as a sellable service
 *   5  Every location binds to a real jurisdiction
 *   6  Every location has enough non-copyable local material
 *   7  Permit-required services never render where he cannot pull
 *   8  Registry items pending, reported with what they block
 *   9  Unverified jurisdictions reported as the blocking gate
 *
 * Checks 1–7 are hard failures. Checks 8–9 are hard failures only when
 * BUILD_TARGET=production, so the site can be developed against placeholders.
